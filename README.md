# Data-Analysis-Validation-using-Keras-Tuner
This repository is dedicated to hold the colab notebook which consists of the data analysis/validation using keras tuner.

**TASK_3_nb1.ipynb file**: renderes the results of all the models , when the data is not scaled i.e( feature scaling is not applied to the dataset)

**TASK_3_nb2.ipynb file**: renders the reults of all the models , when the data is scaled i.e(feature scaling is applied to the dataset)

**I would also like to point out that this was the final problem statement assigned to me after the results were verified for the solution constructed in the first & second round (Data Analysis/Validation using Autogluon API,Time-Series-Forecasting-using-Tensorflow) during the assesment of my skills as the role of intern for the company.**

**Thank you**
